# Hi, there! &#9995;
## About Me

I like finding solutions and improving user experiences. When tech is done well, the user rarely has to think about it. This is the goal! I do the thinking so the user can enjoy the product. 

LaunchCode graduate with HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, Angular, Spring, and SQL experience.
