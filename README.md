# Hi, there! &#9995;
## About Me
I like finding solutions and improving user experiences. When a site is done well, you rarely have to think about it. This is my passion-creating well-planned apps so you can enjoy the content.

For years, I designed sites for teachers and students in the library. I studied site architecture and usability with real-time user research groups and modified the front end to improve usability. Now, as a Full Stack Developer, I look forward to improving front and backend programs to create applications everyone enjoys using. 

LaunchCode graduate with HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript, Angular, Spring, and SQL experience.
