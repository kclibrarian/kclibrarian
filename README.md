# Hi, I'm **Lindsey Lasswell**! &#9995;
## About Me

Improving user experiences with technology by creating intuitive data structure and design is my passion. For over 20 years, I have studied the ways
      people learn and interact with information. As a developer, I am dedicated to applying this to web development.
